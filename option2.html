    <h1> The <i>Naja</i> Project </h1>
    <p>In September of 2019 I began a 6-month internship working with a group of researchers
      who studied the spatial ecology of Monocled and Indochinese Spitting Cobras
      respectively <i>Naja Kaouthia</i> and <i>Naja siamensis</i> hence the name <i>Naja</i> Project. Working with
      a team of interns, my job entailed conducting daily location for between 6 to 13 snakes using 
      radio telemetry. The goal of the project is to better understand how thses two species use 
      their environment. </p>
    <p>In the map below I attempt to map out the general ranges during my six months for
      6 snakes. Each snake is named using the first 2 letters of their scientific name and assigned a number according to 
      how many snakes of that specific species were previously recorded by the project.
      Additionally I mapped out key areas that were staples of my everyday life while at the station (coloured in pink) and spots that myself and other
      interns went to go looking for additional reptiles at night (termed "herping", coloured in green). </p>

    <h1><i>Naja Kaouthia</i> and <i>Naja siamensis</i></h1>
    <p>Although snakes may seem like they may have trouble moving long distances due to the no hands
      and feet thing, let me tell you these snakes can MOVE. In my 6-month expereince we had bi-daily movements
      of over 2km. For a snake that does not generally get more than 1.5m long that is quite the trek to make
      in under 6 hours. Although they were sometimes a pain to follow through the bush as some of them really loved
      Thorn Moracea Forests (forests with trees that have spikes EVERYWHERE) or the incredibly dense Evergreen Decidious
      Forests, these snakes made very interesting subjects as they seemed to have an incredible sense of direction
      and would often revisit specific shelters over the months and remain within a specific area for the majority of
      their lives.

        <h2>Tracking NAKA035 for a Week</h2>
        <p2>In the following map I show one week of movements for NAKA035, also known as <i>Naja Kaouthia</i> 35.
        You can follow the polylines and each point will prompt a popup infowindow that informs you on the distance
        and direction the snake moved. This snake was located in a reasearch station and was often radiotracked into 
        thick Evergreen Decidious Forest. This snake also preffered to shelter within rock complexes. This is data 
        from a week where the snake was mainly being triangulated (from a distance of 10 to 30m) and not pinpointed (when the assigned
        whereabouts are unknown).</p2>
